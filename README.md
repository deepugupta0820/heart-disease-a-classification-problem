# HeartDiseasePrediction-using-various-ML_Algorithms
# Introduction
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the risk of heart disease based on user input. Patients can enter basic health parameters such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol level, and other medical information.

Our model utilizes several machine learning algorithms — including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to deliver accurate predictions. The web app also allows users to generate and print a diagnostic report, making it easy to track and share health status over time.
